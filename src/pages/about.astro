<p>
  The Programme features and is aligned with what internationally recognised institutions and organisations (National Reading Panel, US; Department for Education, UK; National Council for Teachers of Mathematics) deem to be the 'best practices' in the teaching of foundational reading and numeracy skills for children.
</p>
<p>
  This includes the use of explicit, systematic, cumulative curricula and a multi-sensory approach, in addition to the integration of all sub-areas of learning (eg. reading, writing, spelling; mathematics in real life situations). Apart from these, the programme boasts of some special features:
</p>
<ul class="marker:text-cyan-300 mt-4 list-disc ps-5 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
  <li>Personalised teaching, in a one-to-one ratio, to each child's individual challenges and needs, and takes into consideration the whole child</li>
  <li>Integrates several subject areas (eg. English and Literature/Geography) and bridges to standardised exams (PSLE, 'N/O' levels, iGCSEs</li>
  <li>Developed by an educational therapist trained in the field of Specific Learning Difficulties, with extensive experience in the field, both as teacher and teacher trainer</li>
  <li>Takes into account the unique challenges posed by Singaporean culture, language development and school curriculum</li>
  <li>Focuses on building strategies and fundamental concepts, for children from N2 to Sec 4, particularly those with mild to moderate learning difficulties</li>
  <li>Extends to secondary levels for Math, Science, English, Literature, and Geography, supported by our small but dedicated, hand-picked team</li>
