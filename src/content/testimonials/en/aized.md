The name Learning Hearts is apt as the people who make this learning centre happen, operate from their hearts. I first met Julene, who my son affectionately calls Aunty Ju, in early 2018. She was recommended by my son's educational psychologist. I am grateful that she put me in contact with Julene. From the first phone call, I knew that she had my child's interest at heart...
We started with Julene for learning therapy at first. My son was identified with profound dyslexia and he has a lot of anxiety, especially separation anxiety. My son then moved on to be guided by Ellen, and together they put my son at ease. So much so that he looks forward to learning therapy weekly! Fast forward, and my son has improved by leaps and bounds. We will always be in touch with Julene and Ellen, even after Dean graduates from Learning Hearts, as Julene and Ellen are now our confidants. Thank you! Love Aized & Dean
