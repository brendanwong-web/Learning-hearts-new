Attending the MBCT after the MBSR has increased my awareness of the application of mindfulness. They really are complementary programmes that have helped me understand the stress/anxiety triggers and the cognitive therapy techniques that help my personal management. I wish that I had come to mindfulness practice earlier in my life rather than having had disasters trigger the urgency.

I really liked and appreciated all the practices. The pacing was fine and the Content is just so applicable it really speaks to me. Julene’s facilitation abilities to draw on participants’ concerns/feedback/input/contributions brings even more resonance to the content covered in light of the individual struggles we all are facing. To me this is the highlight and where I seem to get repeated ‘ah-ha’ sentiments that bring a smile amidst some synaptic synergy.

Very grateful to be on this journey and realise that it will be a long time before I’m at a place I’m comfortable but that’s ok. This is a journey.
