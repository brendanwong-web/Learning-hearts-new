Our son came under the tutelage of Julene when he was 13, who was recommended by both our educational psychologist and occupational therapist. Julene imparted effective study skills and strategies that helped him become an effective and enthusiastic student.

As his academic results improved, his self confidence also increased. This now translates into a recurring systematic approach to learning new skills and subjects, long after he had left Learning Hearts Therapy. Julene is more than an educational therapist; she is a friend to students and parents alike. She is empathetic, kind, approachable, fun-loving and yet remains driven to ensure her students grow up to be independent and effective learners, and more importantly, to find joy in life Long learning! Thank you Julene!
