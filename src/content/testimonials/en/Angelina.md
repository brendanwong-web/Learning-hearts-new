I met Julene the month before my oldest daughter started mainstream primary school. My daughter was one of those singled out to attend English reading lessons prior to the start of school. She wasn't able to read fluently then and I knew this would be an issue. 

I then engaged Julene to teach both my oldest and younger daughters on a private basis. Ju had a knack of knowing what the girls needed. When it was time to call in the educational psychologist despite extensive therapy, she helped facilitate the process. She was with us during the most difficult times, through the diagnostic process, even in assuring me that all will be well even with both girls being diagnosed with learning disabilities. Whenever each of them needed extra help or attention, Ju would not hesitate to highlight this to me and would give them the extra help they needed. Especially in their final years leading up to their national exams, the girls would both fight to get a slot with Ju. Who does that? But it's kudos to the love and acceptance that Ju has instilled in the girls. They have such confidence in themselves that no one would know that they have any learning disability.  

I'm just grateful to God for putting Ju in our path. She's not just their therapist, she's become their friend and confidante. Truly hard to find a gem like her, and though not the ultimate goal, both girls did extremely well in their Ns and O's - A1 for English and Lit (almost unheard of for a dyslexic child!), single-digit aggregate as well as direct Poly admission.
