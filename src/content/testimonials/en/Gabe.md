I agreed to go for the introductory sessions on English Literature and I learned so much, thanks to Aunty Julene. I also made a few new friends.

I am more confident now as I am able to analyze a text and identify the technique used by an author.  I can also pick out the meaning or moral behind the text written.

I am now able to write a story better and have learned to be more creative in my writing so that it does not seem too bland.  I would like to continue learning as there is still so much more which I donâ€™t know yet.
