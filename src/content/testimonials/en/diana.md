True to their belief, Julene and her team of therapists had supported Sam's growth both academically and emotionally. Sam grew to be a confident student, mindfully aware of her learning needs and became a motivated learner. 


The jouney was not without struggles and challenges; she had to unlearn what she had learnt from typical tutoring teaching pedagogy to being 'therapied' where she and the therapist would work together to close the learning gaps. We often had to prioritise Sam's therapy sessions over her other commitments to ensure the therapy is consistent and regular. Julene and her team also made every effort to conduct additional sessions whenever Sam required them especially near critical exams. 


Apart from the exemplary achievements obtained from the recent IGCSE examinations, Learning Hearts had nurtured Samantha to be a self-discerning   learner which will serve her well in future learning. As a parent, I had also benefitted from many honest and open conversations with Julene in learning to provide emotional support for Samantha. In all, it had been a fulfilling journey with Learning Hearts.
