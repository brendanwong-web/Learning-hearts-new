Two of our children had learning disabilities and could not keep pace with their peers in school. They needed specialized help. We did not know how to help them, but Julene did. In her care, our daughter regained her confidence her reading, spelling and mathematics.
Our son who was delayed in his speech was finally able to learn his alphabet too! We are very grateful for Julene's expertise and kindness that has so profoundly impacted the lives of our children and brought joy in our family.
