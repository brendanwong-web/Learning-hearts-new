I am grateful to auntie Julene who had journeyed with me since 4 years ago when I started my secondary education after i had been diagnosed with dyslexia. 
I started to learsartsrtstrsat to break down difficult concepts in chemistry and biology; I went on to score A* in three of these subjects.
In addition to coaching me in academics, auntie Julene also provided me with emotional counselling and taught me mindfulness techniques so I am self-aware to regulate my emotions. With this stability, I can learn better. Thank you very much auntie Julene, uncle Dan and Brendon.
