Julene and Learning Hearts have been able to coax from my daughter mathematical skills she never knew she possessed. As a Math graduate myself, I was enthralled when I found that my daughter now has confidence in her mental arithmetic and isn't cowed by difficult word problems.  

Beginning with equipping her with skills to deal with dyslexia, Julene and her team have been diligently working with my daughter to help her tackle math and building sound concept that will help her throughout her life.  

I cannot express enough how much I am impressed by the ingenious and logical techniques imparted to my daughter. I hope other parents too will find the support and help their children need in Julene and her methods. The results are not instantaneous but the impact is definitely longlasting.
