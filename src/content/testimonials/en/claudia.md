The Mindfulness course has given me a practical tool for managing my anxiety when facing current challenges with my teenagers. I learnt to hold the space before reacting to their behavior or before negative thoughts in my mind spirals out of control. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to experience a refreshing insight to how the connection between the body and mind can be self-healing when we mindfully live our life.
Special thanks to our coach for her well thought-out plan for in-door and out-door experiences for the entire course which has greatly enriched my Mindfulness journey.
